# Personal Portfolio Website

This is the repository for the personal portfolio website.
It will serve as my central area to show the full breadth of my technical abilities, from serious projects I am part of in industry to my own personal endeavors and investigations.

It places an emphasis on my experience in computational engineering and embedded development.

The portfolio is designed as a static site.
This allows the site to be fast and stable, while also allowing for the developmental emphasis to be placed upon showcasing my experiences as soon as they happen, rather than fixing the website itself.

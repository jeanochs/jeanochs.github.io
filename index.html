						<h2>FEM Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations</h2>
						<!-- Need a photo here.
							Will probably use a photo of a solution state.
							The cards will probably need to be on a row by themsevles. -->
						<p>Using the GNU Scientific Library as the mathematical backend, the solver is currently capable of solving ordinary differential equations (ODE) with constant coefficients via the finite element method. The equation can either be homogenous or nonhomeogenous.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="project_card">
						<h2>Tessella: FEA Battery Analysis</h2>
						<!-- Need a photo here. -->
						<p>The working program of my graduate thesis, Project Tessella was designed to analyze the behavior of solid-state batteries. With each bettery ions grain modeled as a seed region in a Voronoi tessellation, the battery's ion concentration is predictively modeled using first princpiles and the finite element method.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="project_card">
						<h2>CFD Analysis of Drone Propeller</h2>
						<!-- Need a photo here. -->
						<p>During my senior year at Tuskegee University's Additive Manufaturing Laboratory, I was assigned to create a computational model in ANSYS to model the thrust force of an APC drone propeller. The results correlated very closely with experimental resutls, verifying the model's accuracy..</p>
